Just sorta make these things up in your mind, and let them drop in. A thin, and let me say that again, a THIN layer of liquid clear. Always have that little roll of paint. I'll bet you didn't realize you had that much power. Don't over do it -- be careful. Be careful. Look at your painting and make a decision. Let the brush play and have fun -- let it go!</p>
